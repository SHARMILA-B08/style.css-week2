# style.css-week2
This project is an extension of the Week 1 HTML portfolio. In Week 2, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was used to enhance the visual appearance, layout, responsiveness, and user interaction of the portfolio website. The goal was to apply styling principles and create a responsive, modern, and user-friendly interface.
